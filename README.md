# Get to know some of my projects

I’m a business intelligence developer and data analyst with experience working in behavioral science designing experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations of programs with social impact. I’m excited about using my skills in experimentation, Python, SQL, Power BI and Tableau to develop models and visualizations that deliver insights to improve lives.

### Helping Uber drivers maximize profitability of rides
I used data on Uber & Lyft rides to predict demand and assess the profitability of rides. The goal was to inform drivers about the times of the day, weekdays, location and weather conditions when they can expect higher demand, and provide a strategy to maximize profitability. I used Python for the analysis, and developed a Power BI dashboard with insights and actionable recommendations.

## Helping house buyers and sellers negotiate house prices accurately and fairly. 
House prices are influenced by many factors. Some of them are fairly well-known to the general public, but many factors are not known to most home buyers, impairing their ability to negotiate house prices accurately and fairly. I developed a regressive model to predict final sale price of houses based on known house characteristics with Microsoft Excel, and created a technical slide deck to report on process and results.
